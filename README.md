#### Here's some info to get you started:

**1\. Getting Started:**

* I recommend starting with Coinbase, it's easy to use: [Coinbase link](https://coinbase.com/join/4R3JHCC)  
* Robinhood is another option, but Coinbase offers more crypto choices: [Robinhood link](https://join.robinhood.com/ulyssef1)  
* Uphold is good too, especially if you want to explore other assets beyond crypto: [Uphold link](https://wallet.uphold.com/signup?referral=358c417081&campaign=uw_p_d_w_acq_raf&utm_source=raf&utm_medium=referafriend)

**2\. Buying Your First Crypto:**

* **Coinbase Guide:**  
  * **Verify your identity:** Coinbase will need some basic info to comply with regulations.  
  * **Link a payment method:** Connect your bank account or debit card.  
  * **Search for XRP:** Type "XRP" in the search bar.  
  * **Enter the amount:** Decide how much you want to invest (start small\!).  
  * **Review and buy:** Double-check everything and click "Buy."

**3\. Understanding XRP:**

* XRP is a cryptocurrency used for fast and cheap international transfers. It might play a bigger role in finance in the future, but it's important to do your own research. [Article of XRP History](https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/article/xrp-a-history)

**4\. Important Things to Remember:**

* **Security:** It's totally fine to keep your XRP on Coinbase when you're just starting out, especially if you have less than $500 worth. But, if you buy more and your investment goes over $500, it's like having a lot of cash in your wallet – you want to keep it safer. Download the **Xaman Wallet app \- this is a self-custody wallet**, which means you'll have full control over your XRP. Move your XRP there. It's like putting your money in a secure bank account that only you have the key to. Here's why using a self-custody wallet like Xaman is important:  
  * **Your keys, your coins:** When you use **Xaman**, you're in control of your XRP. It's like having the only key to your own safe. No one else can access it.  
  * **Exchange risks:** Keeping your crypto on Coinbase is convenient, but there's a small risk that something could happen to the exchange (like hackers or technical problems). With **Xaman**, your XRP is much safer.  
  * **Write down your seed phrase\!** When you set up **Xaman**, it'll give you a "seed phrase" – a list of words. This is like the master key to your wallet. Write it down and keep it somewhere super safe (like a fireproof box or a safe deposit box). If you lose your phone, you can use this phrase to recover your XRP.
      
* **ISO 20022 is a global standard for electronic data interchange between financial institutions. Cryptocurrencies that are compliant with this standard can integrate with traditional financial systems. Notable ISO 20022-compliant cryptocurrencies include Ripple's (XRP), Stellar Lumens (XLM), IOTA (MIOTA), Algorand (ALGO), Quant (QNT), Hedera HashGraph (HBAR), and XDC Network (XDC).**  

* **Diversification:** Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Consider exploring other cryptocurrencies too.  

* **Risk:** Crypto can be volatile\! **Only invest what you can afford to lose.** and, **Do not forget it's important to do your own research.**
